# Mobile Responsiveness Improvements

This document summarizes all the changes and best practices applied to make the Postman clone fully responsive and user-friendly on mobile devices.

---

## 1. Sidebar & NavBar
- Sidebar transforms into a fixed bottom navigation bar on mobile (`sm:hidden`).
- Increased icon and label size for touch accessibility, but kept proportions reasonable.
- Active tab indicator is clear and visually consistent.
- NavBar remains fixed at the top; Sidebar at the bottom, with main content scrollable in between.
- All icons normalized for size and alignment.

## 2. SettingsPanel
- Switched layout to vertical stacking (`flex-col`) on mobile, horizontal (`flex-row`) on desktop.
- Reduced padding and font sizes for mobile.
- Responsive widths: sidebar section is full width on mobile, fixed on desktop.
- Added right padding for better spacing.

## 3. RestPage
- Main and right panels stack vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop.
- Right panel and vertical divider hidden on mobile.
- Tab bar is horizontally scrollable on mobile.
- Send and Save buttons appear below the URL bar on mobile, inline on desktop.
- HelpShortcutPanel and ResizableBottomPanel hidden on mobile.

## 4. GraphQL Page
- Main and right panels stack vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop.
- Right panel, drag handle, and bottom panel hidden on mobile.
- Tab bars are horizontally scrollable on mobile.

## 5. Realtime Page
- Protocol and help panels stack vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop.
- Help panel and vertical divider hidden on mobile.
- Protocol tab bar is horizontally scrollable on mobile.

## 6. General Best Practices
- Used Tailwind responsive classes (`sm:`, `hidden`, `flex-col`, etc.) throughout.
- Ensured all touch targets (buttons, tabs) are large enough for mobile use.
- Avoided fixed widths and large paddings on mobile.
- Made all navigation and content areas accessible and non-overlapping.
